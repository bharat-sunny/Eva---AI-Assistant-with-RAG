# Eva: AI Assistant with Real-Time RAG

Welcome to **Eva**, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-powered AI assistant that delivers intelligent, context-aware responses by combining large language models (LLMs) with real-time knowledge base updates. Designed for dynamic, information-rich environments, Eva adapts to changes in its knowledge base in real-time, ensuring that users always receive the most relevant and accurate information.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Eva is an advanced AI chatbot powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), making it ideal for applications where up-to-date, contextually accurate information is critical. It utilizes the power of LLMs to generate responses and combines this with a robust retrieval system that pulls real-time data from its continuously updated knowledge base.

**Core Features:**

- **Dynamic Knowledge Updates**: Eva‚Äôs knowledge base is updated in real-time, allowing it to instantly incorporate new information into responses.
- **RAG-Enhanced Responses**: Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Eva retrieves relevant content dynamically, improving the accuracy and relevance of answers.
- **Seamless Query Flow**: Designed for rapid query-response cycles, ensuring users get fast, accurate answers.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Built to handle high volumes of requests efficiently in production environments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Eva is built on a solid foundation of cutting-edge technology:

- **Next.js** for a seamless, server-rendered React experience on the frontend.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for generating insightful, context-aware responses.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to incorporate real-time knowledge retrieval.
- **Real-Time Document Indexing** with vector databases (like Pinecone or Elasticsearch) to manage and serve continuously updated data.
- **Backend**: FastAPI and Node.js for a fast, scalable API layer.
- **Cloud & Orchestration**: Deployed on AWS with Kubernetes for container orchestration, ensuring scalability and reliability.

## üìñ How It Works

Eva‚Äôs real-time RAG functionality allows it to dynamically pull the latest information based on user queries, enhancing the LLM's responses with current data. Here‚Äôs a simplified workflow:

1. **User Query**: A user submits a question or request to Eva.
2. **Retrieval**: The system retrieves relevant, updated content from the knowledge base.
3. **Generation**: The LLM generates a response by combining its trained knowledge with the retrieved information.
4. **Response**: Eva provides the user with a detailed, contextually accurate answer.
